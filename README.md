Messing around trying to duplicate Apple's Vision demo from WWDC '17.

The yellow rects are totally separate from the text onscreen, they're demoing two separate things (Vision finding rects and Inceptionv3 categorizing objects.)

## Running

Just clone the repo and run on your iPhone or iPad from Xcode. You won't be able to run from the simulator. You may need to manage signing by clicking on `VisionDemo.xcodeproj` in the left-hand navigator pane, selecting the `VisionDemo` target and selecting "Automatically Manage" under "Signing."
